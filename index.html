Assignment1 : Creating Your First Web Page
Name: Austin NGuyen, austin_nguyen@student.uml.edu
Date: 9/17/2024
Description: This is the main page of the website that will introduce the user to the different 
methods of brewing coffee. This page will hopefully inform viewers about the growing coffee hobby 
and give links to those further interested. Personally, this assignment served as a basis for a 
combination of learning HTML and CSS without the need for JavaScript. 

Let it be known that are large portion of the code done in this assignment was inspired by the
various tutorials found at https://www.w3schools.com and a handful of youtube tutorial for additional
features such as the colorful table and animated coffee cup. A full list of references can be found at 
the bottom of the page.

		<h2> Introduction to Coffee </h2>
		<article>
			<!-- First introduction paragraph about coffee: its really just filler text-->
			<p> For many, coffee is an essential good that
				has very few substitutes for an early morning boost. 
				Despite widespread usage a  large portion of coffee drinkers rely on just two methods 
				of obtaining their fix coffee shops or drip machines.
				 </p>
			<p> Recently there has been a trend of at-home coffee brewing without using drip machines,
				 where coffee enthusiasts experimented using pour overs, coffee percolators, and modding
				  espresso machines. This website will give a general overview to several brewing methods of  
				  coffee for anyone interested in brewing better coffee
				   at home.

			<h3 style="color: #634832 "> Set-up is everything!</h3>
			<p> There are several factors to consider when choosing their first coffee maker,
				 with the most important being how much time someone would like to invest in 
				their daily cup of joe.
				James Hoffman’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9YnLFrM7Fs&list=PLxz0FjZMVOl0sUXHoxf7sR37D-qtwAGne">A Beginner's Guide To Coffee</a> 
				 videos are an amazing source 
				of information regarding everything from techniques to where to get the fresh 
				and wonderful coffee beans.  </p>
			</article>
			<h3> Four<i> Simple-ish</i> Methods!</h3>
			<article>
				<!-- Filler text, will be taken out on final upload-->
				<h4 style="color: #634832 "> Pour Over </h4>
				<p>
					Pour-overs coffee is perhaps the most similar to the usual drip coffee
					 machines people are familiar with in office spaces and diners. However, 
					 there is much more control involved with pour over coffees allowing for the development 
					 of recipes and technique. Such techniques often create a balanced and “clean” cup of coffee that 
					 is pleasing to almost everyone depending on the beans and recipe.	
					
				</p>
				</article>

				<article>
				<h4 style="color: #634832 "> Aeropress </h4>
				<p>
					The Aeropress is another manual brewer, featuring a cylindrical chamber 
					where coffee grounds can be immersed in hot water for a short period of time and pressed out 
					resulting in a cup that is more rich and full-bodied than those possible by pour-over coffees. 
					</p>
				</article>

				<article>
				<h4 style="color: #634832 "> Moka Pot </h4>
				<p>
					The Moka Pot is a stovetop coffee maker that brews coffee by passing boiling water pressurized by steam 
					through ground coffee. It is a staple in Italian households and is known for its strong and rich coffee. 
					</p>
				</article>

				<article>

				<h4> Espresso Machine </h4>
				<p style="color: #634832 ">
					Espresso machines are the most expensive and complex of the four methods, 
					but they are also the most versatile. Espresso machines can make a variety of drinks 
					including lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos. 
					</p>

		<!-- Grind size comparison -->
		<h2> Grind Size Comparison</h2>
		<article>
			<p> 
			Just as every coffee brewer is different, the size of the grind these machines 
			take are different for each method of brewing. The grind size is important as it
			determines the rate at which water can passes through the coffee grounds, ultimately effecting 
			the taste and flavor of the coffee. While some people own a manaul or electric offeegrinder, 
			many people rely on either pre-ground coffee or grind their coffee at the store if possible.
